# Code Refresh Labs

Lightweight coding warm-ups for days when you want to write code without the grind.

Code Refresh Labs is a small practice site focused on short, focused problems you can solve quickly to stay sharp, rebuild momentum, or warm up before deeper work.

## What this is
- Bite-sized coding challenges
- No accounts, no leaderboards, no pressure
- Focused on learning through repetition and clarity

## What you’ll find
- Short problems across common categories (strings, lists, math, etc.)
- Multiple language support (Python and JavaScript)
- An in-browser editor with instant feedback
- Progress saved locally in your browser

## Why it exists
Not every day is a “grind LeetCode for 2 hours” day.
Some days you just want to sit down and code something small, and that still counts.

## Tech stack
- React + Vite
- TypeScript
- Monaco Editor
- Pyodide (for Python execution)
- GitHub Pages

## Status
This project is actively evolving. New problems and small UX improvements are added regularly.

## Contributing
Ideas, problem suggestions, and improvements are welcome.
Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
